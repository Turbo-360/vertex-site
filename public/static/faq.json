  {"question":"What is the difference between “Global and “Page Configurations?", "answer":"Global configuration and page configuration both serve as the primary tools to customize your site. The page configuration is meant to update content that is specific to a page. For example, the header image on a landing page would be managed under the page configuration. The global configuration is meant for content that applies to every page. For example, since a logo is likely to show up on every page, that content would be managed under the global configuration. Global configuration also manages general content that may not be visual such as the title, key words, or description. The latter type of data is generally used for SEO optimization purposes."},
  {"question":"How can I update the template?", "answer":"Just like any other application, the Vertex 360 templates may have updates. To update your template, first go to “my account”. On the left-hand side, select “sites”. Next to the site you want to update, select the “manage” option. On the left-hand side under “manage content”, open up the settings and select “reset template”. The template of your site will be updated and ready to use in just a few seconds. The content you have already added to your website will remain the same. You can now continue to build your site with the newly updated features!<br /><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0hMsOajT6TlXhkX8Eo-qgT2iq7l4ItUFBAhCAEerQ6wD3PUkIKX6NMf5uJRcrXTX7SX1Gyzqo4mpTL0iqm-5LXU-' /><br /><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dG4zbOZqHMmHwha3oTLl-aXKjXa2AFQB083oDe0JdJFwqO88YY3ZAcdd6QtvUbnDmMMMmGbGevWglPQx-xKXLSCCOg' /><br /><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zhC88ZvAmuxCGVyY2cDhGcawKmkhZGvuwU-UYxW0nuIrJfo_V0z9iI8lMOSx6_LKRjYXUOy_X99ZVIhKSYWzU76D' /><br /><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LOJc7OI1Ah-vvIXSYmOOLOstNs6YpKcYCNa0BO0QAx3aeWi92ob-kU1ZDHjAzIVv9DBIrW_CjNIgZe3ANStDjQbcSuw' />"}
